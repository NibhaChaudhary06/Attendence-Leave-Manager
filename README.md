# Attendence-Leave-Manager
Hi , This is Nibha Singh .
I have created a Python-based terminal application designed to manage and calculate student attendance efficiently. This project automates attendance tracking, leave calculations, and eligibility checks, all within a simple text interface.

## Overview

This project acts as a mini attendance management system that helps instructors or administrators:

- Add new student records  
- Calculate total leaves and attendance percentage  
- Check if a student meets the 75% attendance requirement (as per most academic standards)  
- View and manage all stored records directly from the terminal  

It’s lightweight, VERY beginner-friendly, and shows how to use functions, loops, conditionals, and list data structures in Python to build a real-world management tool.

## Features

- **Add Student Records** – Enter student details with total and attended classes.  
- **Automatic Calculations** – Instantly calculates attendance percentage, leaves, and classes needed for eligibility.  
- **Eligibility Check** – Indicates whether a student is eligible based on attendance.  
- **Record Management** – View or manage all student records added.  
- **Error Handling** – Ensures valid input for total and attended classes.

## How It Works
1. Just Run the Python file:
   ```bash
      python "Attendence & Leave Manger Nibha Singh.py```
